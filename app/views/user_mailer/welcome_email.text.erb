Howdy,

Welcome aboard and thank you for joining the ThinkingRemote community!

We want to build the kind of things our community is most interested in. We would love to hear your thoughts regarding what features you would like us to add, what topics we should cover in our blog, or anything else you have in mind.  

We work remotely and love connecting with other remoters, so even if you have nothing much to say send us a quick hello.
